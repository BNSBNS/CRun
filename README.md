# CRun

mimic a news paper delivery service

as simple as possible



### points  
uniform way to deal with generic pointers; therefore, we prefix their
names with an underscore and only use them to initialize local variables with the desired types and with the appropriate names.  

extern use all outside file  
static use withint file  , also retain value if re called/initialized again  

if using math.h need compile with gcc main.c -o ex -lm  




### refresher notes  
gcc *.c -o main // compiles all .c files  

auto == local variable  

extern == external variable, even more then global var (ie, 2 diff file)  
extern must also be declare outside of anything (like global)
